	Simple snake game written in javascript using HTML 5 elements.
</p>
<p>
	Snake can move in 4 directions and turn. To change his direction use keyboard keys ( up, down, left, right and space ) or tap on gamepad buttons.
	With every food snake will grow and get a little faster. If snake will have no energy it will die. When the snake will touch himself, it will also die.

	Have fun!
